Project Name: Python Regular Expressions Validator
Project Overview:
This Python project demonstrates how regular expressions (regex) can be leveraged for input validation and data processing. The goal of the project is to collect and validate user input such as name, date of birth (DOB), email ID, and mobile number, ensuring that the user follows the specified input format. The project also processes this information, formatting it for further use, and outputs the correctly validated data.
By using Python's built-in re module, the script ensures that only properly formatted data is accepted, and any erroneous input prompts the user to correct their mistake. This is a simple but powerful use case of regex in everyday programming tasks.

Key Features of the Project:
Name Validation:

The program checks if the name contains only alphabetic characters and spaces. This ensures that the name input doesn't include numbers or special characters.
Regular Expression: ^[A-Za-z ]+$
This pattern matches any string containing only uppercase and lowercase English letters and spaces.

Date of Birth (DOB) Validation:

The program ensures that the date of birth is entered in the dd-mm-yyyy format. It also checks that the format strictly follows this pattern with two digits for the day, two digits for the month, and four digits for the year.
Regular Expression: \d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}
This regex matches strings that follow the dd-mm-yyyy format. It does not verify the correctness of the date itself (e.g., 31-13-2022 would pass, although there's no 13th month), but it ensures the basic structure is correct.

Email Validation:

The email input is specifically validated for a Gmail address. It checks that the email follows the username@gmail.com pattern, where the username is composed of lowercase letters and digits only.
Regular Expression: [a-z0-9]+@gmail.com\Z
This regex ensures that only email addresses with lowercase letters and digits before the @gmail.com domain are accepted.

Mobile Number Validation:

The mobile number must follow the format xxx-xxx-xxxx, where x represents a digit. After validation, the non-numeric characters (i.e., hyphens) are stripped from the number.
Regular Expression: \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
This regex ensures that the mobile number input matches the specified format, and the script later processes the input to store the number as a string of digits only.

Data Processing:

After gathering and validating the inputs, the mobile number is stripped of hyphens to store it as a continuous string of digits, which is more useful for further processing or storage in databases.
The date of birth is converted to a more readable format by replacing the numeric month with its three-letter abbreviation (e.g., 01 becomes jan, 02 becomes feb).
These modifications enhance the usability and readability of the data.

Formatted Output:
The script outputs the following information:
Name: The validated name entered by the user.
Date of Birth: The validated DOB formatted as dd-mon-yyyy (e.g., 15-Jun-1990).
Email ID: The validated Gmail address entered by the user.
Mobile Number: The mobile number stored as a continuous string of digits (e.g., 1234567890).

Conclusion:
This Python project provides a practical demonstration of using regular expressions for input validation in real-world scenarios. It is simple yet powerful, and it can be extended in many ways to cater to more complex validation requirements. Regular expressions are an essential tool for developers, and this project is an excellent starting point for anyone learning about regex in Python.
